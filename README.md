# wofi-wifi-menu
*Forked from [vlfldr](https://github.com/vlfldr/rofi-wifi-menu)*

A small and configurable wifi menu for swaywm. Written in bash. Uses wofi and nmcli.

In addition to the original project's dependencies, have a nerd font installed. Replace icons in the shell script as you wish.

**This fork's goals:**
* Make rofi-wifi-menu work with wofi

**This forks' limitations:**
* No manual SSID entry
* WEP networks not tested
* Nerd Fonts interfere with Font Awesome.
FA conversion coming soon.
