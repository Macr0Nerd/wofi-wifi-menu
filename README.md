# rofi-wifi-menu
A wifi menu for i3/openbox/etc. written in bash. Uses rofi and nmcli.

In addition to the original project's dependencies, have a nerd font installed and/or replace icons in the shell script with whatever you like.

**This fork's goals:**
* Make rofi-wifi-menu work with modern versions of rofi
* Fix errors thrown by the original version
* Improve performance & reduce startup lag
* Make the interface even more minimal. Mainly for connecting to previously authenticated networks

**This forks' limitations:**
* No manual SSID entry
* No new network password entry (will be implemented)
